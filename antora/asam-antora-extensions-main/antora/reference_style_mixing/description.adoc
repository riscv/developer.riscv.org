= Mixing of xref styles

== Configuration
To activate this extension, add the following configuration to the extension attributes::
[source, YAML]
----
alternate_xref_style: value <1>
----
<1> `value` may be "full", "short", or "basic".
See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref-text-and-style/[window=_blank] for more information.


.Configuration for using "full" xrefstyle for Anchor links.
====
[source,YAML]
----
antora:
  extensions:
  - require: './asam-antora-extensions/asam-antora_extension.js'
    alternate_xref_style: 'full'
----
====

== How it works
The extension processes each page, first applying the valid Antora reftext attribute to the page, depending on the chosen style.
It then processes the file's content line by line and checks each found xref macro. +
All macros that already have attributes set in the brackets or are links to non-header elements such as images or figures are skipped.
If an anchor is used and the link points to another page, the correct link text is determined and applied.
Otherwise, the xrefstyle attribute is set within the macro to overwrite any global setting temporarily.

NOTE: Due to dependency issues, the attribute is applied in the xref:crossref_replacement/description.adoc[] step and requires this module to be active as well.

IMPORTANT: `\<<link>>` type of links are not parsed!
